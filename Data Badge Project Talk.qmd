## Project origins

-   It all began with a tweet
-   Nick Brown called for volunteers to help with a project
-   All articles in the April 2019 issue of *Psychological Science* earned an "Open Data" badge (the first issue where this was the case)
-   Could a team of researchers reproduce the published results?
-   Of course I signed up!

## Organisation

-   The final team consisted of 12 researchers
-   Varying levels of experience - PhD students & upwards
-   Each paper was allocated to at least 3 reproducers
-   Communication via Google Groups
-   First stage - independent reproduction attempts
-   Uploaded to OSF
-   Phase 1 reports

## My experience

-   I was initially assigned 4 papers to work on (based on expertise)
-   All had data, 2 had code (MATLAB)
-   Time taken per paper: between 2-3 hours and 2 days
-   One without code was easy to reproduce (simple analyses) - Article 101
-   The other without code had VERY raw data
-   Took days, could not exactly reproduce results
-   The two with code were not any easier

## Phase 2 Reports

-   We did not commence this stage until each paper had at least 3 Phase 1 reports
-   I ended up working on a 5th paper due to drop-outs in the team
-   We communicated via threads on Google Groups
-   Wrote summary reports collaboratively on Google Docs
-   Agreed on ratings for each paper
-   How reproducible? Exactly/Essentially/Partially/Mostly Not/Not at all

## Recommmendations

-   Journals offering badges could provide more support for authors
-   Criteria for awarding badges should be clear and explicit (e.g. code, readme, raw data)
-   Badge checks
    -   Authors could provide evidence of independent code checks
    -   Journals could provide this service (via editorial staff or peer review)

## Publication

-   Sophia Crüwell took over as first author to write the final manuscript
-   We submitted to *Psychological Science* in April 2022
-   To our surprise, not rejected!
-   Generally positive, constructive peer reviews
-   After revision, reviewers happy
-   HOWEVER, editor insisted on several more rounds of changes
-   Now accepted, due out soon!
